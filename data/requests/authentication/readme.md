# Authentication

## Check User Exists
Checks if a user by a given `username`, `displayName` or `email` exist. This is used during registration to check if a username has already been taken, during change of displayName to check if a displayName is available, and during change of email to check if the email is already used. In the later two cases the `excludeUserId` is used to exclude oneself, otherwise the result would always be true.

It is **REQUIRED** to include **AT LEAST** `username`, `displayName` **or** `email` query parameter. Although they can be combined - in addition with `excludeUserId` (generally to exclude yourself) - to further fine-tune the search.

## Login and/or Get Current User Info
This endpoint does the following two operations:
  1) Checks if you are already logged in by looking for a valid `auth` cookie. If you are have a valid auth cookie then no additional auth-related actions are taken. If you are **not** logged in then it will log you in with the `Authorization` header and set the `auth` cookie. The `auth` cookie will only be sent once.
  2) If logged in, this function will also return the CurrentUser object containing detailed information about the currently logged in user.

The auth string after `Authorization: Basic {string}` is a base64-encoded string of the username and password, both individually url-encoded, and then joined with a colon.
  
> base64(urlencode(username):urlencode(password))

**WARNING: Session Limit:** Each authentication with login credentials counts as a separate session, out of which you have a limited amount. Make sure to save and reuse the `auth` cookie if you are often restarting the program. The provided API libraries automatically save cookies during runtime, but does not persist during restart. While it can be fine to use username/password during development, expect in production to very fast run into the rate-limit and be temporarily blocked from making new sessions until older ones expire. The exact number of simultaneous sessions is unknown/undisclosed.

**METHOD NOTE:** Despite this being a Delete action, the method type required is PUT.
