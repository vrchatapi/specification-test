# Permissions

## Get Assigned Permissions
Returns a list of all permissions currently granted by the user. Permissions are assigned e.g. by subscribing to VRC+.
* [getAssignedPermissions](./getassignedpermissions.md)

## Get Permission
Returns a single permission. This endpoint is pretty useless, as it returns the exact same information as `/auth/permissions`.
> Missing coverage.
